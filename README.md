### **Welcome to our project repository for the Graduate NLP course!**

This repository will document our journey as we tackle a shared task from the upcoming [SemEval 2026](https://semeval.github.io/SemEval2026/) workshop. Our goal is to research, develop, and evaluate a novel system to solve a complex problem in Natural Language Processing.

## Project Status: Pre-Development

**Current Stage:** Idea Selection & Planning

As of now, this repository is a placeholder for our future work. We are in the initial phase of the project and have not yet selected a specific shared task from the SemEval 2026 list. Our immediate next step is to review the available tasks and choose one that aligns with our interests and the course objectives.
